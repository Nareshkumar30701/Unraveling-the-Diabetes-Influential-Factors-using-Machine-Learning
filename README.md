# Unraveling-the-Diabetes-Influential-Factors-using-Machine-Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to identify the external factors that influence diabetes the most and to develop a predictive model to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic. Utilizing machine learning techniques, the project primarily focuses on data analysis and classification tasks. The final model, based on the RandomForest algorithm, helps in predicting the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on the identified influential factors.

## Key Features
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and prepared for analysis, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The project performs a thorough EDA to understand the distribution of the data, relationships between variables, and identification of the most significant factors influencing diabetes.

Feature Importance Analysis: Using machine learning techniques, the project identifies the external factors that have the most influence on the occurrence of diabetes.

Model Development: A RandomForest classifier is implemented to predict whether an individual is diabetic or non-diabetic based on the influential factors identified.

Model Evaluation: The performance of the RandomForest model is evaluated using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language used for the analysis and model development.
Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
